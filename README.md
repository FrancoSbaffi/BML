Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques
Introduction
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning (ML) algorithms and techniques. The primary goals are:

Enhance understanding of fundamental ML algorithms and models, particularly for newcomers to the field.
Showcase practical, real-world ML implementations.
Keep mathematical and coding skills sharp through practical applications.
Overview
1. FM (Factorization Machines)
fast_fm: Demonstrates usage of the 'fast_fm' package for dataset classification.
FM Rewrite: Implements the FM theory in Python from scratch.
fm_easy_run: Accessible via: pip install fm_easy_run.
2. Xgboost
xgboost Usage: Illustrates usage of the 'xgboost' package for dataset classification.
Gridsearch: Utilizes 'gridsearch' for optimal parameter selection in the 'xgboost' algorithm.
3. N-gram
An alternative to Naive Bayes for solving an interview problem using n-grams.
