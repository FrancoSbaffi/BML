# Introduction
This project explores various machine learning (ML) algorithms and techniques. The main goals are:

Enhancing understanding of fundamental ML algorithms and models for newcomers to the field.
Demonstrating practical, real-world ML implementations.
Keeping my mathematical and coding skills sharp through practical applications.
Overview
1. FM (Factorization Machines)
1.1 Using fast_fm
Demonstrates usage of the 'fast_fm' package for dataset classification.

1.2 FM Rewrite
Implements the FM theory in Python from scratch.

1.3 fm_easy_run
Accessible via: pip install fm_easy_run.

2. Xgboost
2.1 xgboost Usage
Illustrates usage of the 'xgboost' package for dataset classification.

2.2 Gridsearch
Utilizes 'gridsearch' for optimal parameter selection in the 'xgboost' algorithm.

3. N-gram
An alternative to Naive Bayes for solving an interview problem using n-grams.
